# Inverse-Design-of-Hierarchical-Truss
This work investigates non-periodic hierarchical truss structures considering both stiffness and critical load. A decision tree model is proposed to predict heterogeneous hierarchical trusses as lightweight strong structures. Surrogate models learn the ‘mechanical property- optimal truss’ map from a large number of optimization cases.


## Quick start
1. Download ZIP and add all folders to Matlab path.

2. Run readData.m to load the ‘mechanical property- optimal truss’ map and trained surrogate models.

3. Run generateTruss.m to predict the optimal truss under certain mechanical property.
  
4. Run drawTest.m to visualize the results.
